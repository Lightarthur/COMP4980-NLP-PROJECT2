### HOW TO RUN ###

IMPORTANT: text files for all 8 emotions should be located in the same folder as 
python script itself.

1) Run project2.py file
2) Enter first text name/path on prompt and hit Enter
3) Enter second text name/path on prompt and hit Enter
4) Hit Enter to continue to second text's analysis
5) Hit Enter to continue to comparison of both texts


### OBSERVATIONS ###

Because some intensifier words have multiple meanings, it is not completely accurate
to always count them as being an intensifier. A common example would be the phrase 'little boy'.
In this phrase there is a collocational restriction. 'little' does not mean 'little' in sense of
size/magnitude but means 'young'. The most robust way to avoid incorrectly counting this as an
intensifier would be to use semantic analysis to disambiguate between the possible meanings of
'little'. Another alternative would be to maintain a list of exceptions for 'little'. To keep our
implementation simple, we chose not to implement either of these options.

One of the findings suggests that
generally intensifiers are much more common within text than deintensifiers. This may be because our 
list of deintensifiers is incomplete, but we also observe that negations are also not so common compared
to the unnegated forms with the same word.

Important adjustment was to accomodate having stopword in the middle of the 
trigram. In this case we've covered having articles or prepositions, for example,
in our emotional phrases, which turned out to make up more than half of all 
trigrams. However, list of stopwords has been narrowed down to exclude any occuring
ones within emotional lexicon.

In a long run, novelistic oeuvre of two different authors tend to be quite
similar. It was proven by running solution over complete collections of Charles Dickens and George
Eliot novels. 

Elizabeth Gaskell has slightly more use of 'anticipation' expressions and of 'sadness'.
Charles Dickens has slightly more use of 'trust' expressions.
George Eliot has slightly more use of 'anger' expressions.
