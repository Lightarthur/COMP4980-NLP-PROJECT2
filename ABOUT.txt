### OBSERVATIONS ###

    - counting pharases like "little boy" and "young girl" 
Giving provided emotional lexicon, counting of phrases like "little boy" and 
"young girl" occured. This phrases are rahter X than emotional phrases


    - intensifiers are much more popular than deintensifiers
One of the findings suggests that generally intensifiers are much more common 
within text than deintensifiers

charles_dickens_collection:
Intensifier   + emotion:  8007
Deintensifier + emotion:  1794
Negation      + intensifier   + emotion:  243
Negation      + deintensifier + emotion:    9 
Intensifier   + intensifier   + emotion:  184
Deintensifier + deintensifier + emotion:   22

    - taking into account subset of stopwords within trigrams
Important adjustment was to accomodate having stopword in the middle of the 
trigram. In this case we've covered having articles or prepositions, for example,
in our emotional phrases, which turned out to make up more than half of all 
trigrams. However, list of stopwords has been narrowed down to exclude any occuring
ones within emotional lexicon. 

charles_dickens_collection:
Trigram total count: 3393
Negation      + stop word + emotion: 1615
Intensifier   + stop word + emotion: 1048
Deintensifier + stop word + emotion:  129 

george_eliot_collection:
Trigram total count: 1659
Negation      + stop word + emotion:  933
Intensifier   + stop word + emotion:  362 
Deintensifier + stop word + emotion:   79

elizabeth_gaskell_collection:
Trigram total count: 1495
Negation      + stop word + emotion:  670
Intensifier   + stop word + emotion:  498
Deintensifier + stop word + emotion:   84
