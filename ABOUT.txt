### HOW TO RUN ###

IMPORTANT: text files for all 8 emotions should be located in the same folder as 
python script itself.

1) Run project2.py file
2) Enter first text name/path on prompt and hit Enter
3) Enter second text name/path on prompt and hit Enter
4) Hit Enter to continue to second text's analysis
5) Hit Enter to continue to comparison of both texts


### OBSERVATIONS ###

Because some intensifier words have multiple meanings, it is not completely accurate
to always count them as being an intensifier. A common example would be the a phrase 
'little boy'. In this phrase there is a collocational restriction. 'little' does not 
mean 'little' in sense of size/magnitude but means 'young'. The most robust way to 
avoid incorrectly counting this as an intensifier would be to use semantic analysis 
to disambiguate between the possible meanings of 'little'. Another alternative would 
be to maintain a list of exceptions for 'little'. To keep our implementation simple,
we chose not to implement either of these options.


----------------------


One of the findings suggests that generally intensifiers are much more common 
within text than deintensifiers. This may be because our list of deintensifiers 
is incomplete, but we also observe that negations are also not so common compared
to the unnegated forms with the same word.

----------------------


Important adjustment was to accomodate having stopword in the middle of the 
trigram. In this case we've covered having, for example, articles or prepositions
in our emotional phrases, which turned out to make up more than half of all 
trigrams. However, list of stopwords has been narrowed down to exclude any occuring
ones within emotional lexicon.

----------------------


In a long run, novelistic oeuvre of all three different authors tend to be quite
similar. It was proven by running solution over aggregated collections of Charles 
Dickens, George Eliot and Elizabeth Gaskell novels. 

Elizabeth Gaskell has slightly more use of 'anticipation' expressions and very 
slightly of 'sadness'.
Charles Dickens has slightly more use of 'trust' expressions.
George Eliot has very slightly more use of 'anger' expressions.

Charles Dickens has sightly more positive emotion expressions compared to Elizabeth 
Gaskell and George Eliot.

All negated emotions appear to have roughly equal distribution. In the grouping by positive/neutral/negative, the negated negative is larger than positive/neutral since
the negative category has 4 emotions vs 2.
Interestingly, this is not the same for the unnegated emotions. The 4 negative emotions
have a roughly equal proportion as the 2 positive emotions. This could be because the 
lexicon used for the positive emotions of trust/joy are broad enough to capture the 
same number of words as fear, disgust, sadness, anger combined.
